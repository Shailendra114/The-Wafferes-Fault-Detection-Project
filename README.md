# The-Wafferes-Fault-Detection-Project
This Project is about Fault Detection In Wafferes Based On Sensor Data.

# Problem Statement:-
The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors. There are two classes: +1 and -1.

A wafer we can see in the picture below-

+1 means that the wafer is in a working condition and it doesnâ€™t need to be replaced.

-1 means that the wafer is faulty and it needs to be replaced.
# Data Description:-
The client will send data in multiple sets of files in batches at a given location. Data will contain Wafer names and 590 columns of different sensor values for each wafer. The last column will have the "Good/Bad" value for each wafer.

"Good/Bad" column will have two unique values +1 and -1.

"+1" represents Good wafer.

"-1" represents Bad Wafer.

Apart from training files, we also require a "schema" file from the client, which contains all the relevant information about the training files such as: Name of the files, Length of Date value in FileName, Length of Time value in FileName, Number of Columns, Name of the Columns, and their datatype.
# Data Validation:-
In this step, we perform different sets of validation on the given set of training files.
Name Validation- We validate the name of the files based on the given name in the schema file. We have created a regex pattern as per the name given in the schema file to use for validation. After validating the pattern in the name, we check for the length of date in the file name as well as the length of time in the file name. If all the values are as per requirement, we move such files to "Good_Data_Folder" else we move such files to "Bad_Data_Folder."

Number of Columns - We validate the number of columns present in the files, and if it doesn't match with the value given in the schema file, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder."

Name of Columns - The name of the columns is validated and should be the same as given in the schema file. If not, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".

The datatype of columns - The datatype of columns is given in the schema file. This is validated when we insert the files into Database. If the datatype is wrong, then the file is moved to "Bad_Data_Folder".

Null values in columns - If any of the columns in a file have all the values as NULL or missing, we discard such a file and move it to "Bad_Data_Folder".
